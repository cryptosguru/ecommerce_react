### Using Source code

- **Clone Git repository**

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cezerin2/cezerin2
cd cezerin2
```

- **Change settings**

```shell
cd config
```

  - MongoDB Credentials

  Save file and go back to root app direcotry

  ```shell
  cd ../
  ```

- **Install dependencies**

```shell
npm i
```

- **Setup database**

Prepare database at this setup our database is empty. To add default data, indexes and access token we need to run:

```shell
npm run setup <email> <domain>
```

- We don't have real domain, so we'll use our local domain:

  ```shell
  npm run setup admin@example.com http://localhost:3000
  ```

- You can change this email and domain anytime at Admin - Settings - General - Domain and Admin - Settings - Personal Access Tokens.

- **Build project**

```shell
npm run build
```

- **Start application in the background**

```shell
pm2 start process.json
```

- or you can start app in your terminal (you will see debug information, that is useful for debug):

```shell
npm start
```
