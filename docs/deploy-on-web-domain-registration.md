## 2. Setup domain

1. We have hosting (digitalocean droplet) for our cezerin web site.

Now we need a domain name, to open our store like this
```
https://cezerin.net 
```
not by ip address like:
```
https://123.456.789.0
```

2. You need to register any domain name at any domain regstrator.

For example, we have cezerin.net domain and we need to make available cezerin online store on https://cezerin.net

3. Ok, we have domain name and we have domain name control panel. 


1. Click **Create droplet**

- Choose an image: `Ubuntu 18.04.4 x64`
- Choose a size: `2 GB (RAM), 1 vCPU, 50 GB (SSD)`
- Choose a datacenter region: `San Francisco`

2. Then SSH to droplet.
